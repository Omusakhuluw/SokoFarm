        Once upon a time, there lived a man next to the forest. The man was a farmer who decided to live a
        little bit far from people because he desired a large piece of land to farm. Every season the man harvests
        a lot of fruits, vegetables, maize, potatoes and pumpkins and sells them to the villagers in the market.
        <p>It passed that for about three months, the rain had not rained in the area. Wild animals started coming 
            from the forest looking for sheeps and goats kept by villagers as food. </p>
